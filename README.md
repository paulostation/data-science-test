# Data Science Test

The test consists of creating a tweet dashboard to showcase text mining, data visualization, statistical analysis and development skills.

- The app needs to stream tweets written in **Portuguese** from twitter API .
- The app needs to classify tweet sentiment (e.g. positive, negative, mixed and neutral). 
- The app needs to show tweets being classified in real-time in a dashboard.
- The classifier must be written in Python, as it is our language of choice regarding data science. The rest can be written in your language of choice.
- Feel free to use python libraries, no need to write things from scratch.
- Accuracy report
  - What metric are you using? Why ?
  - Which type of test did you choose ?
  - Include the test dataset.

Please, as an extra effort, include in your solution the following:
- Dashboard with metrics (e.g. charts with tweet sentiment, time series, etc etc).
- Your code should be scalable.
- Your code need to be on your GitHub profile.
- Your code need to be hosted on a Cloud provider.
- Your code need to run inside docker containers, bonus points if running inside a Kubernetes Cluster.
