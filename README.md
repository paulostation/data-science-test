# Data Science Test

The test consists of creating a tweet dashboard to showcase text mining, data visualization, statistical analysis and development skills.

- The app needs to stream tweets written in Portuguese from twitter API .
- The app needs to classify tweet sentiment (e.g. positive, negative, mixed and neutral). 
- The app needs to show classified tweets in a dashboard.
- The classifier must be written in Python, as it is our language of choice regarding data science. The rest can be written in your language of choice.
- Feel free to use python libraries, no need to write things from scratch.

Please, as an extra effort, include in your solution the following:
- Dashboard with metrics (e.g. charts with tweet sentiment, time series, etc etc).
- Your code should be scalable.
- Your code needs to be on your GitHub profile.
- Your code needs to have unit tests.
- Your code needs to be hosted on IBM Cloud.
- Your code needs to run inside docker containers, bonus points if running inside an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Cluster.
